# Music Station


This application is for purchasing guitars and different music instruments online.
I specifically developed this application to demonstrate the use of AngularJS functionalities like ng-route, services, directives, filters etc.
I'm fetching the data from JSON file using AJAX call and displaying the data to user.
User can select instruments of his choice and fill the information on next page.
When the information is complete, user can proceed to buy the instrument.

Technologies used are: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, AngularJS, jQuery, AJAX, JavaScript.
